# Data Job listing Analysis Project

## Project Description
The analytics field is on the rise worldwide. In this project, we take a closer look at the US job market about DA jobs. This analysis helps understand different features like which keywords are used in job titles for data related roles and which industry posts the most data jobs, etc. The Datasets from sources were used and the ETL process along with other software was used to analyze and visualize data. The goal of the project was to take data from multiple sources and use different data related software to analyze data and present the finding. We found different sources of data on job opening positions for data analysts,data engineers, and data scientists. The datasets were gathered from different sources such as Kaggle and glassdoor. That data was cleaned and refined using jupyter and python using pandas and numpy. Then the new tables were taken and uploaded to AWS S3 buckets. That data was bulk loaded into MYSQL to run queries. Then tableau was used to visually present the data. There were different datasets containing more than 2000 job listings for data engineer,scientist, analyst and positions, with features such as Salary Estimate, Location, Company Rating (From Glassdoor), Job Description and more. The company rating is based on the employees who work in the company while glassdoor will calculate the ratings from their algorithm. The queries were used to answer important questions like What is the average estimated salary for a data related job in each city around the Bay Area? How many data related jobs are in each state, and other information the analysis could extract.
